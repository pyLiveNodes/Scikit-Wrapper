# Livenodes Scikit Wrapper

The wrapper provides a simple interface to create and run Livenodes graphs as a Scikit-Learn Estimator. This allows the use of LN graphs in all Standard Scikit-learn workflows, starting with cross-validations, grid search or even pipelines.

## Installation:

```bash
pip install ln_scikit --extra-index-url https://package_puller:8qYs4hBAsmAHJ5AdS_y9@gitlab.csl.uni-bremen.de/api/v4/groups/368/-/packages/pypi/simple
```

## Livenodes & LN-Studio
Livenodes are small units of computation for digital signal processing in python. They are connected multiple synced channels to create complex graphs for real-time applications. Each node may provide a GUI or Graph for live interaction and visualization.

//LN-Studio is a GUI Application to create, run and debug these graphs based on QT5.

Any contribution is welcome! These projects take more time, than I can muster, so feel free to create issues for everything that you think might work better and feel free to create a MR for them as well!

Have fun and good coding!
